<h1>Announcing the 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual <strong>Branches Gathering!</strong></h1>
<p class="text-xl">March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025 &bull; Hidden Spring Farm, Deerfield, NH</p>

<p class="text-lg">We invite you to join us once again for a gathering of Christian creatives in New England where we will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Worship our Creator together </li>
	<li>Have meaningful conversations about what it looks like to be a Christian creative</li>
	<li>Enjoy breakout sessions in the areas of Visual Art, Music and Writing</li>
	<li>Eat incredible food</li>
</ul>

<p>Our theme this year is, "He Gives, We Gather" Psalm 104.</p>

<p>As Christian creatives, God has given various gifts for us to steward, and has prepared in advance good works for us to do (Ephesians 2:10). What an awesome thought! We'll explore how we can prepare so we're ready to gather when God provides the opportunities.</p>

<p class="text-lg"><strong>Registration launches January 6th!</strong></p>

<h2>What Is Branches?</h2>
<p class="text-lg">We are a local group of New England creatives who passionately believe that each person has been made in the image of God, and as part of that image-bearing we are created to create.</p>

<p>We hope that the pieces we make (whether they are visual art, music, writing, etc.) are a call to our neighbors next door, across the fence and down the lane, our companions on this journey through life.</p>

<p>A call to remember our Creator as we live out our lives in the  intermediate space between the Garden and the Restoration. As we wrestle with the fallenness of our world (the tensions of joy and sorrow, peace and suffering, being present while we look to the future), we believe that the arts can be a means that God uses to minister to our hearts and give us strength, courage and community.</p>

These additional costs will be listed on the <a href="/schedule/">schedule page</a> as soon as breakout sessions are finalized.</em></p>

	<h2 class="mt-0">Why “Branches”?</h2>
	<p>Our theme verse for our day is John 15:4:</p>
	<p class="text-lg">"Abide in me (Jesus), and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me." (ESV)</p>

	<p>The visual of branches reminds us:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We were made to bear fruit. Let’s use the gifts God has given us to do what He’s calling us to do.</li>
		<li>Our fruit comes from abiding in Jesus. He is our source of creativity.</li>
		<li>We have roots and don’t have to change with the wind.</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="text-lg">And so we ask ourselves the question…”How am I branching out?”</p>
