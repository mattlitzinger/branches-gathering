<h1>Announcing the 2<sup>nd</sup> Annual <strong>Branches Gathering!</strong></h1>
<p class="text-xl">March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2025 &bull; Hidden Spring Farm, Deerfield, NH</p>

<p class="text-lg">We invite you to join us once again for a gathering of Christian creatives in New England where we will:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Worship our Creator together </li>
	<li>Have meaningful conversations about what it looks like to be a Christian creative</li>
	<li>Enjoy breakout sessions in the areas of Visual Art, Music and Writing</li>
	<li>Eat incredible food</li>
</ul>

<p>Our theme this year is, "He Gives, We Gather" Psalm 104.</p>

<p>As Christian creatives, God has given various gifts for us to steward, and has prepared in advance good works for us to do (Ephesians 2:10). What an awesome thought! We'll explore how we can prepare so we're ready to gather when God provides the opportunities.</p>

<p><em><strong>A note about the cost increase:</strong> Last year (our very first year) we were so grateful that all of our presenters graciously volunteered their time. This year, along with covering general conference costs, we would like to give a small donation to each of our conference presenters. We trust that you will still find the conference to be a delightful value for the content given.</em></p>

<h2>What Is Branches?</h2>
<p class="text-lg">We are a local group of New England creatives who passionately believe that each person has been made in the image of God, and as part of that image-bearing we are created to create.</p>

<p>We hope that the pieces we make (whether they are visual art, music, writing, etc.) are a call to our neighbors next door, across the fence and down the lane, our companions on this journey through life.</p>

<p>A call to remember our Creator as we live out our lives in the  intermediate space between the Garden and the Restoration. As we wrestle with the fallenness of our world (the tensions of joy and sorrow, peace and suffering, being present while we look to the future), we believe that the arts can be a means that God uses to minister to our hearts and give us strength, courage and community.</p>
